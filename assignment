Question: Explain the different types of testing(unit, integration, system and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance. Answer: Software testing is a critical part of Software Quality Assurance (SQA), ensuring that applications function correctly, efficiently, and securely. Below are four key types of testing:

Unit Testing Definition: Unit testing focuses on testing individual components or functions of a software application in isolation. Purpose & Importance: • Ensures each function or module works correctly. • Detects bugs early before they propagate. • Makes code refactoring safer, as tests verify functionality remains intact. Example: Testing a login function to check if it correctly validates usernames and passwords. Tools Used: JUnit (Java), NUnit (.NET), PyTest (Python), Jest (JavaScript).

Integration Testing Definition: Integration testing checks how different modules or services interact when combined. Purpose & Importance: • Ensures smooth communication between modules (e.g., frontend & backend). • Identifies interface mismatches or broken API connections.

• Validates data flow correctness between components. Example: Testing if the user authentication module correctly interacts with the database and API. Tools Used: Postman, SoapUI, JUnit, Selenium.

System Testing Definition: System testing evaluates the entire application to verify it meets functional and non-functional requirements. Purpose & Importance: • Ensures the complete system works as expected. • Tests the software in real-world scenarios and usage conditions. • Detects system-wide issues like performance, security, and usability problems. Example: Testing an e-commerce website to ensure that user registration, product search, checkout, and payment systems work seamlessly together. Tools Used: Selenium, LoadRunner, JMeter.

Acceptance Testing Definition: Acceptance testing determines if the software meets business and user requirements before deployment. Purpose & Importance: • Ensures the software is ready for release and aligns with user expectations. • Identifies missed requirements that developers may have overlooked. • Prevents major failures after deployment. Types of Acceptance Testing: • User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Performed by the end users to confirm usability. • Alpha Testing: Conducted in-house before releasing to users. • Beta Testing: Released to select users for feedback before a full launch. Example: A banking app undergoes UAT, where real users test it to ensure it meets their needs before public release. Tools Used: TestRail, Cucumber, JIRA.

PART 2: INTRODUCTION TO AI AND PROMPT ENGINEERING Question: Define Prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models Answer: Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and optimizing prompts to effectively interact with AI models like ChatGPT, Bard, and DALL·E.
